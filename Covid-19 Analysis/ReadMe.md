### Problem Description
We have to build a predict the prices of a Bitcoin by building a predictive model. Before making a model, we are required to go through a series of steps like data collection,
data exploration, data cleaning and then we will make our predictive model.

#### Microtask-1 Introduction to Quantitative Modeling
- To understand about Linear models (specifically additive or proportionate models)
- In Simple Interest, principal remains constant and interest is calculated on initial principal, here the growth remains always absolute so it is an example of additive linear model.
- In Compound Interest, the interest for eventual time periods remain dependent on the initial principle and the interest just before, here the growth is proportionate so it is an example of proportionate linear model.  
**Assessment Question: Among additive and proportionate, which would you associate with the spread of pandemic?**

**Answer:** proportionate

#### Microtask-2 Commonly Used Mathematical Function

**Assessment Question: What mathematical function would we use to model the spread of a pandemic or epidemic?**

**Answer:** exponential

#### Microtask-3 Data Collection and Visualization
- Download the dataset and visualizing the records
 
**Assessment Question: What were the total number of cases on 04/03/2020?**

**Answer:** 31

#### Microtask-4 Model The Solution
As observed the trend of the pandemic is exponential in nature.

- Fit the model into an exponential mathematical function such that P_t = P_o*(e^(r*t)), where t is time period, r is rate of increase, P_t is predicted forcast and P_o is initial value.  
**Assessment Question: Use the computed r in the formula to make the forecast and find P_t. Take your P_o = 31 and t = 26. Round off to the nearest integral value**

**Answer:** 1459
